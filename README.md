# Refcode

**Refcode** is a Visual Studio Code extension that enhances your coding experience by allowing you to copy selected code and render it using a customizable template to your clipboard. It supports various template variables and filters to customize the output. Additionally, it provides a status bar icon for quick copying of code using the specified template. It also supports post-actions, enabling you to call custom commands to process the rendered text, such as uploading it to a code bin.

## Features

- Copy selected code rendered using a template.
- Supports the following template variables to handle the selected code:
  - `path`: The file path.
  - `relpath`: The relative file path.
  - `outline`: The outline path of it. Like `Foo Â» useEffect() callback`
  - `lineno`: The starting line number of it.
  - `colno`: The starting column number of it.
  - `linenoEnd`: The ending line number of it.
  - `colnoEnd`: The ending column number of it.
  - `lang`: The language of the code.
  - `content`: The content of it.
- Allows template filters, including `stripIndent` and `strip`.
- Here is a template example: "`{relpath}`:\n```{lang}\n{#stripIndent}{content}{/stripIndent}\n```".
- Displays a status bar icon for quick copying using the given template.
- Supports post-actions, allowing you to call custom commands to process the rendered text.

NOTE:

- If you want to customize a post-action command, your program should print the result to stdout.
  - If the command exits with a non-zero status or has stderr output,
    the copy operation will be aborted. An error message will be raised, and nothing will be copied.
